# To Do / Investigate

*	Export to *EcuFlash* format?

*	Reminder to save on exit if data has been modified.

*	XML overwrite warning. `Ctrl+S` does not display file dialog, won't ask, destroying existing foreign file!

*	Table items UI: Add filtering.
   Current workaround: sort by title, category etc. - click colum header twice after load.
   That way, already annotated items appear on top of the list.

*	Add UI to modify value formatting (decimal places).
   Currently there's a little bit of fixed automatic logic in code.

*	Add UI to display/adjust/toggle table record multiplier + offset.
   Currently not displayed at all, only appear in RR XML export.

*	Table items UI: Make use of check mark column

	i.e. Export all vs. selected or items with added metadata

*	For ScoobyRom XML: Automatically determine and save suitable table search range.

*	Add UI for ROM info (xmlid) lines. Plus copy & paste via clipboard maybe.

*	Update visualization on metadata changes? Currently only icons are updated - after value type change.

*	Add IDC script generation features.
